## :wave: Austin Atchley is a software engineer based in NYC


I attended the University of Texas at Austin in 2020 with honors with degrees in computer science and liberal arts. I took part in the Plan II Honors program, which replicates a liberal arts college experience within UT. I wrote an [undergraduate thesis](/documents/thesis.pdf) analyzing the philosophical underpinnings of the development of self-driving car technology, exploring ethical challenges faced by developer, end-users, and moral agents alike. 

During college, I worked at Amazon as an intern, on teams where I worked on a range of different projects -- from game engine development to authentication and identity web services used as core internal Amazon infrastructure. In industry, I have worked for 3 years full-time at Amazon in Seattle, as an SDE working on internal tooling and infrastructure. In this time, I have developed interests in development on backend and distributed systems using cloud technologies such as AWS Lambda, DynamoDB, CloudWatch, and Route 53.
