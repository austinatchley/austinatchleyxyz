## :wave: Austin Atchley is a software engineer in Seattle, WA


I graduated from the University of Texas at Austin in 2020 with honors with degrees in computer science and liberal arts. I attended the Plan II Honors program, which does its best to replicate a liberal arts school experience within a state school. 

I currently work at Amazon as an SDE working in identity and access management. I previously was as an intern on teams where I worked on C++ game engine development and federated authentication web services. I wrote an [undergraduate thesis](/thesis.pdf) on the philosophical underpinnings of the development of self-driving car technology, exploring ethical challenges faced by the developer, the end-user, and the moral agent.
