## :wave: Austin Atchley is a software engineer based in NYC


I graduated from the University of Texas at Austin in 2020 with honors, earning degrees in computer science and the Plan II Honors program, which provided a strong liberal arts curriculum to my education. I wrote an [undergraduate thesis](/documents/thesis.pdf) analyzing the philosophical underpinnings of the development of self-driving car technology, exploring ethical challenges faced by both software developers and all users of technology. 

I worked at Amazon as a software engineer for two summers during college, on a range of different projects -- from game engine development to authentication web services used as core internal Amazon infrastructure. After college, I continued to work at AWS in the Seattle headquarters for 3 years. During this time, I focused on building critical internal infrastructure services. 

I left Amazon in August 2023 to [travel around the world]({{<ref "/posts/rtw" >}} "rtw.md") and [move to New York City]({{<ref "/posts/nyc">}}). In NYC, I worked remotely for a pharmacy tech startup called [NimbleRx](https://www.nimblerx.com/).

Recently, I joined Meta to work on their cross-product advertising platform, acting as a systems generalist. On my team, I work alongside ML research scientists, ML engineers, and other software engineers to support the [Reservation Campaign feature of Meta's ad platform](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/885674161555708?id=842420845959022).
