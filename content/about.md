## :wave: Austin Atchley is a software engineer based in NYC


I graduated from the University of Texas at Austin in 2020 with honors, earning degrees in computer science and liberal arts. I took part in the Plan II Honors program, which replicates a liberal arts college within UT. I wrote an [undergraduate thesis](/documents/thesis.pdf) analyzing the philosophical underpinnings of the development of self-driving car technology, exploring ethical challenges faced by developers, end-users, and those who are not involved directly but affected just as much. 

I worked at Amazon as an intern for two summers during college, on teams where I worked on a range of different projects -- from game engine development to authentication and identity web services used as core internal Amazon infrastructure. In industry, I have worked for 3 years full-time at AWS in Seattle, as an SDE working on internal tooling and infrastructure. In this time, I have developed interests in backend development and distributed systems, using cloud and serverless technologies such as AWS Lambda, DynamoDB, CloudWatch, and CDK.
