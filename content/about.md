## Hey there 👋 welcome to my website 

I'm a software engineer and musician based in NYC. A generalist by trade, I enjoy building worlds with code and sound 💻 🎶

I graduated from the University of Texas at Austin in 2020, earning dual degrees from the computer science department and a [liberal arts program called Plan II Honors](https://liberalarts.utexas.edu/plan2/curriculum/). I wrote an [undergraduate thesis](/documents/thesis.pdf) analyzing the philosophical underpinnings of self-driving technology, exploring ethical challenges from the perspectives of developers, drivers, and passengers.

During college, I completed several internships in different orgs across Amazon -- working on projects ranging from game engines to distributed systems. After college, I continued to work for AWS in Seattle. During this time, I focused on building security and identity services, largely using AWS's own serverless technology.

I left Amazon in August 2023 to [travel around the world]({{<ref "/posts/rtw" >}} "rtw.md") and [move to New York City]({{<ref "/posts/nyc">}}). I worked for [NimbleRx](https://www.nimblerx.com/), a YCombinator-backed prescription delivery startup.

In 2024, I joined Meta to work on their advertising platform. I work as a SWE building Meta's suite of brand advertising products, primarily focusing on the pricing prediction service that powers [Reserved buying for Meta ads](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/885674161555708?id=842420845959022). This service simulates Meta's advertising auction process to help advertisers predict delivery and maximize return on spend.
