## Music Projects

I release music as [os.10](https://open.spotify.com/artist/4mEtNdDrhc0JhcgE7kUN1b) under my project [postbag](https://www.instagram.com/postbag.prod) alongside [Sudarshan Iyengar](https://srsiyengar.com/), my friend and frequent collaborator. 

Recently I've also started to record and produce for some of my other friends as well. Here is a running list of credits:
* [Not a party by n.ara](https://distrokid.com/hyperfollow/nara22/not-a-party?utm_source=ig&utm_medium=social&utm_content=link_in_bio) (produced, mixed, mastered)
