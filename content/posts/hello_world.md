## Hello World!

This is the first post on this website. It uses static pages generated by Hugo and hosted in S3. To reduce latency, it uses CloudFront in front of S3 as a CDN. There's also a Lambda@Edge function that routes requests within the S3 bucket that contains all the static files. The site uses AWS Certificate Manager to manage its SSL/TLS certificate.

I run deployments using Hugo's built-in S3 bucket deployment feature, which has the added benefit of automatically running a [CloudFront invalidation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/Invalidation.html) to remove old static files from the edge.
