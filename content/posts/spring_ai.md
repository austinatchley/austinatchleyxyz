In a small gap between two jobs, I started working on a simple idea for a creative, multi-modal (text-to-text and text-to-image) AI-based web application. I had been tracking [the open-source development](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-ai) of [the Spring AI project](https://spring.io/projects/spring-ai), and thought it would be the perfect opportunity to evaluate the project for my idea.

While life has gotten in the way of my finishing of the project so far (the frontend is essentially non-existent still :skull:), it has been a genuinely fun experience to use tools for building AI-backed applications. I find that their methods of usage breed creativity, and the lack of limitations makes the ideation process enjoyable.

The idea is to build something that sparks creativity in response to small bits of user input, generating a multi-modal whole by chaining multiple individual generative pieces in succession, introducing more creativity with each additional link by feeding the summation of the whole into each new step.

Link to the [backend](https://github.com/austinatchley/poesie) and [frontend](https://github.com/austinatchley/poesie-frontend) codebases on GitHub. I'm hoping to get a working demo up sometime in the near future, before my focus gets shifted to other projects.
