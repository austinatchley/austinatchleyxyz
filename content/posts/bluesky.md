I never used Twitter (I guess that's the Zoomer side of the Zillenial in me), but since signing up for Bluesky, I've been pleasantly surprised with the quality of content. Their [starter pack feature](https://bsky.social/about/blog/06-26-2024-starter-packs) makes it easier than ever to get high quality posts delivered straight to your news feed.

Also their ["domain name as handle" feature](https://bsky.social/about/blog/3-6-2023-domain-names-as-handles-in-bluesky) is pretty nifty for those of us who feel it's important to have their own space on the web. Plus you can [host your own data](https://bsky.social/about/blog/02-22-2024-open-social-web), which prevents any potential future hostile takeovers from influencing where you put your data.

As much as the death of a platform like Twitter sucks, the silver lining is that it inspired [a ton of smart people to start working on decentralized social media](https://bsky.app/starter-pack/raulmarin.dev/3law4cowena2n). IMO, Bluesky has far greater potential for popular appeal than something like Mastodon, and I'm hoping it starts to overtake Twitter this year.

If you haven't checked it out yet, I would encourage you to give it a shot. [You can find me under this domain](https://bsky.app/profile/austinatchley.xyz)
