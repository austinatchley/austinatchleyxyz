While recovering from my second bout of COVID, I have been looking back through the pictures I took on my around-the-world trip this summer ([which you can read more about here](/rtw)). On the Europe leg of the trip, we were lucky enough to visit some of the best museum cities in the whole world, but we also found some great art in the most unexpected places. Excluding famous works, I've selected some of my favorites below:

## Paris

### Petit Palais

### 59 Rivoli

59 Rivoli is a free art gallery in Paris that was formerly occupied by squatting artists. It was legalized by the city in 2006. This particular corner gave me some visual inspiration for the album I'm working on titled _arboretum_, which is slated for release in 2024.

## Basel

### Kunstmuseum

## Bonus Round

I can't find the full painting, but I couldn't stop laughing at this little guy.
