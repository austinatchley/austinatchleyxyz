While recovering from my second bout of COVID, I have been looking back through the pictures I took on my around-the-world trip this summer ([which you can read more about here]({{< ref "/posts/rtw" >}})). On the Europe leg of the trip, we were lucky enough to visit some of the best museums in the world, but we also found some inspiring art in unexpected places. Excluding famous works, here are some selected favorites:

## Paris

### Petit Palais

The Petit Palais is a free museum in Paris, and in my opinion, one of the hidden gems. There are some great works inside, and the palace itself is beautiful as well.

### 59 Rivoli

59 Rivoli is a free art gallery in Paris that was formerly occupied by squatting artists. It was legalized by the city in 2006. This particular corner gave me some visual inspiration for the album I'm working on titled *arboretum*, which is slated for release in 2024.

## Basel

### Kunstmuseum

Basel was probably the museum high-point of the trip, and the Kunstmuseum was the best of the museums we saw. I highly recommend going if you're in the region.

## Vienna

### Belvedere

Klimt's "The Kiss" gets all the attention at Belvedere, but there are some masterful portraits spread all through the gallery. These two in particular stuck out to me.

## Bonus Round

I can't find the name of the full painting, but I couldn't stop laughing at this little guy.

## Conclusion

That's it for now, but I have way too many pictures of this trip. I would love to create some more collections around different ideas (e.g. architecture, gardens, food, etc.), and I might. But that all depends on how fast I recover from COVID and have to get back to work 😜 Stay tuned for more! ✌️
