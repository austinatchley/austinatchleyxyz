Although I tend to prefer alternative methods of transport to cars for travelling within cities, there is something to be said for the joys of traversing the open roads of America in a personal automobile. Last week, I drove solo from Seattle, WA to Austin, TX in my Dodge Challenger over the course of four days. With most of my belongings in tow, I made the trip in preparation for my move to New York City in September. As someone who has mixed feelings about cars (especially ones of the gasoline-fueled variety) and their impact on the Earth, I spent much of the trip thinking about my relationship with the roaring machine under my grip.

Having spent the last 3 years living in Seattle, I have come to see how much a halfway decent public transit network can transform life within a city. During trips to Europe and New York City, I've also gained glimpses of the type of comprehensive transit network Seattle cannot hope to achieve any time soon. Day-to-day, most of our trips -- whether it be to work, the grocery store, or dinner -- are within a several mile radius of us. For these trips, car travel can't hope to compete with cycling or public transit in a place where these things are valued. But most of America doesn't value these modes of transportation, and as a result, the only option is to drive a personal vehicle, suffer through traffic, finding a parking space, insulate yourself from the reality of your surroundings, and either pump emissions into the atmosphere with a combustion engine or strip the Earth of precious resources for an electric car.

However, on long trips between cities, states, or even countries, plane travel insulates us even more than cars, lifting us up above the land and satisfying our modern sense of impatience. Cars or trains allow us to keep a finger on the pulse of the vast lands between our point of departure and our destination. While we can't spare so much time for every trip, the thrill of seeing the colors change as they whizzed by me, the rush of an engine getting up to speed to pass on a two-lane highway as a car suddenly appears in the opposite lane over the horizon, the uniquely American experience of it all, was a good reminder that there are benefits to slow travel.

All this being said, not all of the benefits of long-distance travel over land are unique to cars. The need for a truly viable passenger rail line in the US has gone unattended for too long, and it's a big part of the reason I'm so excited to travel across Europe in the coming weeks. Until some time in the future where we reach critical mass for building large-scale rail networks, I will continue to dream of the day where we can all see these benefits without having to concern ourselves with the environmental impacts of our pleasure.
