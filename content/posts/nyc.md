After living in Seattle for the past 3 years, I moved to New York in August. I decided to live in Manhattan, and I'm currently working on my [message-in-a-bottle](https://github.com/austinatchley/message-in-a-bottle) fullstack web app project while getting settled in a new apartment.

Already, I've definitely enjoyed having full access to the subway system. It feels magical to explore Manhattan without having to rush, with frequent visits into Brooklyn and the other boroughs along the way. While it's increasingly _not_ a cheap city, New York has a certain charm that other American cities lack, and I'm glad to be living here for the next phase of my career.
