After living in Seattle for the past 3 years, I moved to New York in August. For my first apartment, I found an apartment in Yorkville on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, and I'm currently working on my [message-in-a-bottle](https://message-in-a-bottle.fly.dev/) fullstack web app project while getting settled.

Already, I've definitely enjoyed having full access to the subway system. It feels magical to explore Manhattan without having to rush, with frequent visits into Brooklyn and the other boroughs along the way. While it's increasingly _not_ a cheap city, New York has a certain charm that other American cities lack, and I'm also glad to be benefitting from the unparalleled access to career opportunities while searching for my next job.
