# This website

I recently finished setting up this Hugo static-generated site. The project is hosted on AWS, using an S3 bucket with the static site option enabled. I knew I wanted to put the statically generated files on the edge for quicker access using CloudFront, but I ran into issues using the default configuration for this combination. 

In the process of working on this project, I found that it was extremely simple to upload my Hugo-generated site to an S3 bucket, enable static site hosting, and navigate to the messy S3-generated URL. However, it was much harder to get everything working with a CDN, custom domain, and correctly configured SSL/TLS certificates, which were my goals for this project. I want to briefly outline my experience with this process in case anyone else runs into these issues in the future.

## Where Problems Started Coming

Requests for an S3 static site that are served through CloudFront are routed differently than if the assets were served by the S3 bucket itself. Hugo sites served from S3 buckets depend on built-in routing functionality that retrieves the `index.html` page by default when a user requests the root folder path (example: `/posts/`). 

When using CloudFront, this functionality ceases to work, and any assets that don't explicitly name the filepath in the S3 bucket will redirect to the home page. Because of this, assets like CSS and images will also fail to load. This prevents the Hugo website from functioning as intended, so we need to come up with some other way of routing requests to the correct static files in the bucket.

```javascript
'use strict';
exports.handler = (event, context, callback) => {
    
    // Extract the request from the CloudFront event that is sent to Lambda@Edge 
    var request = event.Records[0].cf.request;

    // Extract the URI from the request
    var olduri = request.uri;

    // Match any '/' that occurs at the end of a URI. Replace it with a default index
    var newuri = olduri.replace(/\/$/, '\/index.html');
    
    // Log the URI as received by CloudFront and the new URI to be used to fetch from origin
    console.log("Old URI: " + olduri);
    console.log("New URI: " + newuri);
    
    // Replace the received URI with the URI that includes the index page
    request.uri = newuri;
    
    // Return to CloudFront
    return callback(null, request);
};
```
