I am excited to announce that ARBORETUM, the second album under Post Bag Productions, is [now streaming on all platforms! Listen now!](https://distrokid.com/hyperfollow/postbagproductions/arboretum)

This is a project I've been working on for the past year along with my creative partner, [Sudarshan](https://www.instagram.com/sudhabuddha/). We perserved through several cross-country moves (from Seattle to Manhattan to Brooklyn, and from Seattle to Dallas), busy schedules, and many creative blocks to put this project out. We're so excited that everyone can finally listen to it, and share a view into our lives over the past year.

Check out the album if you dig it, or [come follow us on Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/postbagproductions/) for more visual content.
