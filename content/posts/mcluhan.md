I was first exposed to the ideas of the Canadian philosopher Marshall McLuhan in a talk by Chris Cox (CPO of Meta) at the Menlo Park campus. McLuhan's work centers around media studies, which is a sub-discipline of philosophy that isn't often taught in introductory or intermediate philosophy courses.

After digging deeper into the work of McLuhan alone, I felt that it was strange I had never heard of some of these ideas given how predictive they proved to be. Perhaps the discipline is more valuable as an analytical tool rather than a predictive one, but it is certainly intriguing that people such as today's Silicon Valley elite could use these ideas to build a predictive framework for steering the development of new technologies. Here's a video I found recently that dives into a bit of McLuhan's work:

The channel is run by a professor who makes video essays that closely resemble university-style lectures. I would also recommend a few of his other videos, specifically the ones on Noam Chomsky and Guy Debord:
